<p>This is a task manager website made in CodeIgniter. Below are some of the basic features included in this website:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Login / Register</li>
    <li>Create, Edit and Delete Projects</li>
    <li>Create, Edit and Delete Tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is a model to show how the Task Manager's features work</p>

<p>In this example there are 2 users, User A and User B</p>

<p>User A creates a project called 'Test Project One'. Only User A is able to access 'Test Project One' and any tasks within that project. If User A can add tasks in to 'Test Project One', edit them and/or delete them. If User A wishes to grant User B access to 'Test Project One', he can do so by going to the project settings page and inviting User B by incerting User B's email in to the input. User B will then have an invite ready on his home page. After accepting the invite, User B will have full access to 'Test Project One'</p>
